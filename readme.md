# init.php
An init system written (almost*) entirely in PHP.

 * I say "almost" because it requires the php_mount php extension.

# Rationale
Oh yeah, I'm gonna prove to everybody that PHP is the only language 
you need to know! 
Why would you use this instead of a great init system line systemd? 
Well, although systemd is the best thing available, it is written in 
a clearly inferior language, C. Why should someone learn and use C when 
a higher level language like PHP exists?

Note: This is clearly a joke. I don't actually think this is a good 
idea.
